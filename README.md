# 5G-Non-Terrestrial-Systems
This research shows that overcoming propagation delays, Doppler effects, power limits, and dynamic topologies is key to achieving seamless, reliable, and cost-effective global connectivity. The findings guide engineers in developing next-gen 5G and beyond 6G satellite-terrestrial systems for universal coverage and digital transformation.
